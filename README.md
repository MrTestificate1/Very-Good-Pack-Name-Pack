# Very-Good-Pack-Name-Pack
=========================


This is the DEVELOPMENT version of the pack. The README will get fancier as needed.
NOTE: You will have to configure minecraft to your liking, the settings are NOT DEFAULT!
The reason for this is that the pack is designed to work on MrTestificate1's terrible PC.
This may be a plus or minus to you, we are limited to mods but SHOULD work on low-end machines!
If you find any issues with performance that you know how to solve, please post it in the issues.
